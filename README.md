# Relative-Strength-Stock-Finder
Ranks stocks based on their positive performance when the over all index was down. The theory is that strong stocks will push through negative market days, however upon further analysis it is infact the opposite. Really weak stocks in downtrends show relative strength during negative market days. My theory is that these short positions are closed down, which leads to mini short squeezes. 
Thoeretical Trade:
Short stocks that squezed up on the day due to these "mini short squeezes".
